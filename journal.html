    <h3>Inspiring site: <em>The Haircut</em> the visual essay by Frances To</h3>
    <a href="https://the-haircut.webflow.io/">Link to the website</a>
    <p>I really like how engaging and entertaining, and immersive this website is. Smooth scroll animations and symbolic imagery make the narrative of the story so much more enjoyable. In addition, I like how each part of the story is presented in a different yet cohesive way. </p>

        <h3>Project 1 Idea: <em>Beneficial Insects</em></h3>
        <p>I want to make a website for the company selling beneficial bugs. I've worked on a rebranding for this company, and I would like to apply the brand guidelines to this project. I draw inspiration from the scientific illustrations of the insects and a warm and friendly color palette.There are no specific websites I am modeling after. However, I would like to make something similar to the visual storytelling websites, where each page tell a story in different ways as you scroll down.</p>

        <p>I really like the combination of this illutration style and the bright color palette. The animated eliments make the page to feel more lively</p>
