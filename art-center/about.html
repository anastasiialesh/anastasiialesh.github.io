        <p>The Woodburn Art Center has been serving the Woodburn community in the arts and art education since 1966 when ten visionary local artists founded the Woodburn Art League and began meeting in one another's homes to paint. We have now expanded into a non-profit organization housed in a beautiful space, run by a very dedicated group of volunteers and supported by an active membership of over 80 artists, crafts people and patrons in our community.</p>
            <p><b>Our purpose is to promote, stimulate, develop and extend public art appreciation and the individual development of members and the community at large in the various art forms through teaching, training and instruction in the fine arts.</b>

            <p>Ray Glatt donated this century old farm house to the Woodburn Art League in 1976 in memory of his late wife, Elizabeth and her passion for the arts. The house has been known as the Glatt House Gallery and home to the art league ever since. The league changed its name to the Woodburn Art Center and became a 501 (c) 3 nonprofit organization in 1972. With a growing membership traditions such as attracting high quality artists to the center to offer classes, selling supplies, creating a lending library and holding frequent art shows begun by the earliest members still continue today.
            </p>
                <p>In 1998 the vision to expand the Glatt House became a reality when the Sindberg Studio addition was completed. It provides open studio space for artists and a spacious classroom for the numerous art classes sponsored by the WAC for children and adults in the community. The Glatt House Gallery is now a professional fine arts gallery where each month a different themed art display features the works of one or more artists. These shows are designed to educate and inspire our gallery guests and members.</p>
                    <p>The Woodburn Art Center and Glatt House Gallery is a landmark and true gem for our community to be proud of. It is open to everyone and all are welcome. Volunteers and members through the years who love the arts have preserved it for today and we, the current members are committed to maintaining and preserving the house for the appreciation and development of fine arts in Woodburn and the surrounding communities for the future. Come and join us today.</p>
