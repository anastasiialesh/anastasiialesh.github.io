            <h2>[Hippodamia convergens]</h2>
            <p>Ladybugs are general predators that feed on a variety of slow-moving insects, but they are best known for feeding on aphids. During the adult and larval stages it is a predator. Adults are shiny, hemispherical beetles, often reddish-orange or yellow, with black markings. Larvae are black, with conspicuous legs and orange spots on their backs. They move from plant to plant on leaves. Larvae pupate on the upper leaf surfaces, plant stems and twigs. Eggs are yellowish-orange ovals, laid on end in clusters of 10 to 50.

                <h2>Release Instructions:</h2>
                    <p><b>Prior</b> to release, mist the foliage beforehand to improve performance. With ample food and moisture, Ladybugs can begin reproducing immediately.
                
                    <b>Release</b> Ladybugs in the evening, early morning, or when it's cool, as Ladybugs will move more slowly during these times. Cloudy days are perfect all day.
                
                    <b>Open</b> the container and gently tap the insects onto the base of the infested plants because Ladybugs like to climb upwards as they seek food.
                
                    <b>Leave</b> the container in the area for 24 hours after the release to allow Ladybugs to exit.
